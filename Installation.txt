REMARKS

After Hard_Configurator deinstallation:
1. The System Restore is turned ON, which is the default setting in Windows Vista and Windows 7. It is good to keep this setting ON, when installing security programs. If not required, it can be manually turned OFF, using the the Control Panel or running the Windows tool --> SystemPropertiesProtection.exe  .
2. The SwitchDefaulDeny tool is copied to the Public Desktop, and it is available for managing the MS Office settings on the particular account.
