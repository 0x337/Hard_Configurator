INSTALLATION

1. Close Hard_Configurator (if running). Run Hard_Configurator_setup(x86).exe for 32Bit Windows version or Hard_Configurator_setup(x64).exe for 64Bit Windows version.

2. The program will be installed in 'Windows\Hard_Configurator' folder. It can be run, using a shortcut from the Desktop.


QUICK CONFIGURATION

1. On the first run, let Hard_Configurator make System Restore Point and check/whitelist autoruns - it costs nothing, and can save you a lot of time when in trouble.
2. When the above job is done, the Tools window may be closed, and the main Hard_Configurator window should appear.
3. If you do not know much about SRP (Windows built-in Software Restriction Policies), press only <Recommended Restrictions> button to configure restrictions. SRP are powerful, so using them without knowledge can be painful.
4. If you know more about SRP or you like to test it with other restrictions, press first <Recommended SRP> button, and next <Recommended Restrictions> button to make a quick configuration (the order of pressing the buttons does matter!). 
5. The changes are applied, when pressing <APPLY CHANGES> button.
6. Read the help files to get info about Hard_Configurator options.
7. Full information about a program and SRP can be accessed using <Documentation> button.
