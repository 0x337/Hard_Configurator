#Important info for Windows 10 Creators Update (compilation 15063.13). 

Due to integration with Windows Defender, Microsoft made some important changes in the SmartScreen Application Reputation.
So, the Hard_Configurator setting <Run As SmartScreen>='Administrator', fails to force SmartScreen for all files - it works
just as the standard 'Run as administrator'. 
I have to make some tests to figure out if the previous functionality of this setting could be recovered in the Windows 10
Creators version.
Until this will be done, here are the recommended Hard_Configurator settings:
<Run As SmartScreen> = 'Standard User'
<Hide 'Run As Administrator'> = 'OFF'

With the above settings, when SRP are activated, one can still use the SmartScreen when installing programs from User Space.
But, both options: 'Run By SmartScreen' and 'Run as administrator', from Explorer context menu must be used:
After using 'Run By SmartScreen' the program is blocked by SRP, but 'Mark of the Web' is added and the program is checked by SmartScreen.
'Run as administrator' allows to bypass SRP and install the file.

So SRP + 'Run By SmartScreen'', with the above settings, can be used as any other, second opinion anti-malware scanner.
